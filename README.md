# Weather Forecasting with Keras

This script is what was used to predict the next day weather forecast (sampled per hour) in my thesis paper: Microgrid Energy Management System Development for Remote-Island Electricity Access

Make sure that the following libraries are installed in your working environment: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, keras, scipy, and tensorflow.

## Usage

To use this repository, enter in the terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lesterphillip/weather-prediction.git
```
And run the script

```bash
python3 weather_forecasting.py
```

Follow the instructions by inputting the model needed.
